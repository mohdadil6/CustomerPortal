07/11 Created in ReactJS and NodeJS as of now. Used Bootstrap Navbar, made some pages like Home, Contact, About, Media etc using ReactJS. There's an part where I have to save data string in Database and retrieve it from Database to display it over webpage. So here I used NodeJS temporarily to save and retrieve data.
